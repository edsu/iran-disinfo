You should be able to pull down the Twitter data and run the analysis with `make`:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:edsu/iran-disinfo.git
$ cd iran-disinfo
$ make
```

If all goes well a series of datasets will be downloaded, unzipped and then
processed. You can find the output in the `results` directory.
